# TORG CONFLICT in VTT and Discord

Players I have some thoughts on improving our conflicts, especially in a discord and VTT setup, where it's easy to have awkward pauses and stepping on other people trying to talk. Torg ALSO does not just create marching orders for you when there is a fight. There is no "who is the fastest...they go first" thing. Instead it works very differently and understanding the difference will also go a great distance in resolving this problem.

So when the drama deck flips we get a bunch of information. 
	1. We learn the "tone" of the round through the flavor text. 
	4. We see which side goes first. And we see if there are any conditions that will apply to either or both sides. All of these are important factors that play into how you can (and maybe should) play the round. 
	5. You also get some information for use with Dramatic Skill Resolution (DSR), and 
	6. you get the "Approved Actions" for that round. These are the actions you can take to earn another Destiny Card...so that's a big incentive, especially at the beginning of the conflict.

OK let's apply these numbers to a sample drama card.

So let's say that this is a standard encounter. Heroes will immediately take 2 Shock from Fatigued.

Now, if we were playing at a table...almost immediately, the "table-talk" begins, a meta-extravaganza! Other RPGs have tried to squash this practice in favor of "staying in character". But in Torg, you will regularly flip back and forth from in-character to out-of-character. And this is the moment where all the players drop out of character and "game the game."

You are now all looking over the map, looking over card pools, and discussing overall Hero strategies. You are going to talk to each other about possible moves you might make, reminding others what you are good at and what you suck at, so you can all collaborate and play to your strengths.

Talking together, you work out your over all plan...
	• this plan is going to include:
		○ who is going to trade cards with who; 
		○ who is going to act first or last; 
		○ who is going to support who, or team up (gang up) on who, etc.

This just would happen naturally at my table when playing in person. 

But online, we are missing a lot of physical cues, etc., on who can talk and when. Nobody wants to step on others but it's inevitable, so you either just plow ahead and do it, or just stay quiet, and that leads to awkward silences. LOL....not your fault! It's the nature of the beast.

Here is what I came up with to address this "online" factor: 
	1. GM turns over the drama card signaling the start of the round. Effects are played, initiative is announced (by side), and approved actions are noted.
		a. NOTE: It has been suggested that for each conflict, a new "player leader" is announced by the GM. This person will be the one keeping players on track as described below, and calling on players when needed to give their input. This will free the GM up to do GM-things instead. :)
		b. And I LIKE that idea. :) So when players start to learn the basics of action-flow this will be the standard. A new player leader can be chosen each conflict…or the that night's session.
		c. As a reward for taking the roll, the GM can offer a Possibility to the player's character.

	2. Players look over the card and look over the field of action. If villain's turn, Players are looking at what they might be able to interrupt them with, or determine if an "active defense" is in order (i.e. if Villains are UP) and otherwise wait and see what the bad guys do....working out ideas for what needs to be done on the Heroes turn. As GM, I will be busy rolling dice and sorting out results in the narrative.

	3. On their side's turn, players drop out of character and briefly discuss what kinds of things they can do. It’s collaborative. It’s meta. It’s table-talk planning. It doesn't matter if one player can or can't see the other, or if they are in earshot…these are PLAYERS talking. So, the player can be getting in the head of the PC and thinking about what they might do, but there is also an effort to discover "who has what cards out that can help me if I trade, what cards do *I* have or that can help someone else who needs help, and what strategy should we use,"…blah…blah.
	4. So for Step 3, to make it even more orderly, the Player Leader of GM can also just run down the list of players and cue you to give your input. Like "OK, Tom, state your intention this round". Then once we have gone "around the table real quick" you are all invited to jump in and make suggestions ask questions, etc. Since we are online, and the chaos can rise quickly, rather than vocally interrupt another player, you can CHAT some ideas or input (we should USE THE VTT CHAT for that) while another is talking. And then in the process of doing this...you will naturally come to an order of actions. Players who are going to try to do Interactions should probably go before the ones they are trying to help out. And so forth.
 
	5. Ok. Players now have a basic plan, and they know what to do, and in roughly what order, so the GM or the Player Leader shouldn't even have to ask "Who's next?"
	6. So the players now drop out of META-mode and back to in-character, saying their clever lines, and narrating their awesome and dramatically cinematic actions, for all the other players and GM to see in their mind's eye and enjoy. They act out their plan. Maybe they adjust that plan a little here and there, depending how rolls go, and if the plan survives contact with the enemy. You get the idea.
	7. The key here is that the FICTION is now in play. Players are in-character now. They are describing their actions and filling in the fiction of how the die rolls fall.
	8. Of course, they may need to step out of character again to talk to the GM or other players about how they are going to use a Possibility Point, or a card, or something like that, but then they drop back into character and narrate what that looks like when they do that.
	
So, this will make combats/conflicts much more interesting, and also FEED faster--mostly because players are more highly engaged throughout the process as they collaborate instead of just wait for their turn to go.

It is fun and exciting to tell the story of what you worked out in the meta-planning, reflecting how to dice roll with (or against) you, right? 

How do you support the use of your Hero or Drama card? Tell the story to us.
How do you explain the use of your Supporter card, or your Leadership card? Describe it to us. This is YOUR story.

Tell the thoughts and feelings of what it's like for you to dig down and use a Possibility when the die did not work well for you initially... we will LOVE listening to your character's fiction. 

I personally think that will take this game up a big notch. We just all need to shift our habits a little...and get used to dropping out of character and back into it again, as when we narrate all that meta we planned out.
